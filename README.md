# portfolio

I wanted to make a portfolio that encompasses my personality and/or the things I love. I was running out of time brainstorming many ideas and figured that my passion for technology, mainly Apple, could guide me to an aethetic and fun webpage for my portfolio. 

While this is subject to change, and has a lot of work to make fun functional additions, the base remains as a webpage that succeeds in showcasing my abilities, and in the future, my ever-adapting personality and interests.
